# Box2D-Gravity

This project is a Box2D simulation that implements Newton's law of universal gravitation to simulate gravitational forces between dynamic bodies. It is developed as a project for the Physics 2 class at CITM University.

## Overview

The main goal of this project, created for the Physics 2 class at CITM University, is to showcase the behavior of gravitational forces using Box2D's physics engine. The simulation involves creating a 2D environment where dynamic bodies interact with each other based on the gravitational pull they exert on one another.

## Features

- **Simulation of Gravitational Forces:** Bodies within the simulation interact with each other according to Newton's law of universal gravitation.
- **Box2D Integration:** Utilizes Box2D, a popular 2D physics engine, for handling the physics simulation.
- **Visualization:** Provides visualization of bodies and their interactions within the simulation.

## Setup

To run this project locally:

1. **Dependencies:** Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed.
2. **Build:** Build the project using the provided build system or IDE.
3. **Run:** Execute the simulation to observe the gravitational interactions between bodies.

## Usage

- **F1:** Activate / Deactivate debug mode
- **1:** Spawn planet on mouse position
- **2:** Spawn crate (debug purpouses)
- **3:** Spawn chain (debug purpouses)
- **Left Click:** drag bodies (only if debug mode is ON)
